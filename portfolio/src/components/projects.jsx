    <h6>Predicting Housing Prices using Regression and Feature Engineering</h6> <br />
Developed a machine learning model to accurately predict housing prices by analyzing a wide range of property features including location, size, number of rooms, and available amenities. Carried out extensive data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Applied feature engineering techniques to create new informative features and improve model performance. Explored multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressor using the Scikit-learn library. Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score to select the best-performing model.
